  abstract = 	 {Generic generation and manipulation of text is challenging and has limited success compared to recent deep generative modeling in visual domain. This paper aims at generating plausible text sentences, whose attributes are controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics. We propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures. The model can alternatively be seen as enhancing VAEs with the wake-sleep algorithm for leveraging fake samples as extra training data. With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls, and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model learns interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces short sentences with desired attributes of sentiment and tenses. Quantitative experiments using trained classifiers as evaluators validate the accuracy of sentence and attribute generation.}

  abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f&isin;C<sup>N</sup> and a randomly chosen set of frequencies &Omega;. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set &Omega;? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=&sigma;<sub>&tau;&isin;T</sub>f(&tau;)&delta;(t-&tau;) obeying |T|&le;C<sub>M</sub>&middot;(log N)<sup>-1</sup> &middot; |&Omega;| for some constant C<sub>M</sub>>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N<sup>-M</sup>), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the &#8467;<sub>1</sub> minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C<sub>M</sub> which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|&middot;logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N<sup>-M</sup>) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|&middot;logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

	abstract = {No consistent conclusions have been drawn from existing studies regarding the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent approaches to learning from imbalanced data. In this paper we apply bias-variance analysis to study the utility of diﬀerent strategies for imbalanced learning. We conduct experiments on 15 real-world imbalanced datasets of applying various re-sampling and induction bias adjustment strategies to the standard decision tree, naive bayes and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) learning algorithms. Our main ﬁndings include: Imbalanced class distribution is primarily a high bias problem, which partly explains why it impedes the performance of many standard learning algorithms. Compared to the re-sampling strategies, adjusting induction bias can more signiﬁcantly vary the bias and variance components of classiﬁcation errors. Especially the inverse distance weighting strategy can signiﬁcantly reduce the variance errors for k-NN. Based on these ﬁndings we oﬀer practical advice on applying the re-sampling and induction bias adjustment strategies to improve imbalanced learning.},

  abstract = 	 {Algorithmic decision making systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety of online as well as offline services. These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead, even in the absence of intent, to a lack of fairness, i.e., their outcomes can disproportionately hurt (or, benefit) particular groups of people sharing one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex). In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism to design fair classifiers by leveraging a novel intuitive measure of decision boundary (un)fairness. We instantiate this mechanism with two well-known classifiers, logistic regression and support vector machines, and show on real-world data that our mechanism allows for a fine-grained control on the degree of fairness, often at a small cost in terms of accuracy.}
