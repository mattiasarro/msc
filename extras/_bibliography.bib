	title = {An {Empirical} {Study} of {Learning} from {Imbalanced} {Data}},
	abstract = {No consistent conclusions have been drawn from existing studies regarding the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent approaches to learning from imbalanced data. In this paper we apply bias-variance analysis to study the utility of diﬀerent strategies for imbalanced learning. We conduct experiments on 15 real-world imbalanced datasets of applying various re-sampling and induction bias adjustment strategies to the standard decision tree, naive bayes and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) learning algorithms. Our main ﬁndings include: Imbalanced class distribution is primarily a high bias problem, which partly explains why it impedes the performance of many standard learning algorithms. Compared to the re-sampling strategies, adjusting induction bias can more signiﬁcantly vary the bias and variance components of classiﬁcation errors. Especially the inverse distance weighting strategy can signiﬁcantly reduce the variance errors for k-NN. Based on these ﬁndings we oﬀer practical advice on applying the re-sampling and induction bias adjustment strategies to improve imbalanced learning.},

	abstract = {In this paper we compare different types of recurrent units in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that implement a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a recently proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these recurrent units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than more traditional recurrent units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be comparable to LSTM.},
