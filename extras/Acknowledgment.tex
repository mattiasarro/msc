I would like to wholeheartedly thank my thesis examiner Magnus Boman for the patient and unconditional support I received throughout the thesis.
A special thanks to RISE SICS for providing a working space at an earlier stage of this thesis.
Interacting with my examiner and SICS researchers has been among the most valuable part of my thesis, and I am grateful for the opportunity.
During the period leading up to the successful defence of this work I have had the privilege to get advice from and have insightful discussions with numerous people.
