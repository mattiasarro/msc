\section{Input Representations}

\subsection{Categorical Input}

The simplest option for representing categorical input is 1-hot encoding, where input has as many dimensions as there are distinct categorical values; a single dimension is set to 1, with all other dimensions set to 0.
This is a straightforward representation: for a simple model such as logistic regression, we can clearly interpret the model parameters and see how the presence or absence of a given category increases or decreases the likelihood of a given output.
