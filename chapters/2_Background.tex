\section{Input Representations}
\label{data_rep}

\subsection{Categorical Input}

The simplest option for representing categorical input is 1-hot encoding, where input has as many dimensions as there are distinct categorical values (vocabulary size); a single dimension is set to 1, with all other dimensions set to 0.
This is a straightforward representation: for a simple model such as logistic regression, we can clearly interpret the model parameters and see how the presence or absence of a given category increases or decreases the likelihood of a given output.
However, in cases where vocabulary sizes get  large, and the number of outputs (the number of units in the next layer in a deep network,  or the number of output units  in a shallow one) increases, this kind of encoding can really blow up the number of parameters of the model.
 this has many negative consequences: more memory, more required train data - curse of dimensionality

An alternative is to use  random embeddings:  dense, low-dimensional representations of a high-dimensional vectors.
It has been shown in compressed sensing literature that if a high-dimensional signal in effect lies on a low-dimensional manifold, then the original signal can be reconstructed from a small number of linear measurements \cite{compressive_sensing2}.
This has a useful implication for machine learning: categorical variables with large vocabularies of size \textit{d}  can be  represented with  random embedding vectors of size $M = \log(d)$.
This because it is possible to reconstruct any d-dimensional k-sparse signal using at most $k  log{\frac{d}{k}}$ dimensional vectors \cite{compressive_sensing1}, and 1-hot vectors are 1-sparse (only one dimension is nonzero).

An intuitive example is given in \cite{compressive_sensing3} about natural images: a 1-million-pixel image could have roughly 20,000 edges\footnote{technically: wavelet coefficients with a significant power, which roughly corresponds to a superimposition of edges}, i.e. it lies in a roughly 20,000-dimensional manifold from which the original image can be constructed with little loss in quality.
The 1-million-dimensional image could be projected into a M-dimensional space ``by taking M measurements of the image, where each measurement consists of a weighted sum of all the pixel intensities, and allowing the weights themselves to be chosen randomly (for example, drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution)''\cite{compressive_sensing3}.
The projection these random because the weights for the sum of pixel intensities are chosen randomly.
Why the projections need to be random is motivated by another intuitive example:  when light is shined on a 3-dimensional wireframe, its shadow is a 2-dimensional projection of it.
The projection could lose some important information about the regional object if the direction of the light source is chosen poorly,  however random directions are likely to result in projections where every link of the wire will have a corresponding nonzero length of shadow.

\subsection{Text Input}

The simplest way to represent  text is bag words (\textbf{BoW}),  which  is simply the histogram of word occurrences  in the text.
BoW  representations give equal weight to each of the words in the text, and the model has to learn the relative importance of each of these.
A commonly used representation in information retrieval (IR) is \textbf{TF-IDF},  which stands for ``term frequency -  inverse document frequency''.
TF-IDF  multiplies the term frequency (number of times the word occurred in the text) with its inverse document frequency ( the inverse of how often a occurs in all documents).
This has the effect of giving lower scores for common words, and higher scores for words which appear often in a document but not too frequently in the whole corpus.
Another common representation is bag of n-grams (\textbf{BonG}), which  is a histogram of character n-grams.

The above representations are sparse: there are vector representations grow linearly with the vocabulary size.
Text can also be  represented as a sequence of \textbf{word embeddings}.
Words and betting can either be random vectors or representations  learned with word cooccurrence algorithms such as word2vec \cite{} and GloVe \cite{};  these representations can remain fixed throughout the learning procedure, or updated as part of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when applicable.
A simple yet surprisingly powerful way to represent text is to average the word embedding contained in it \cite{}.
The  average could also be weighted by the TF-IDF score of each word\footnote{the author is unaware whether this has been tried before, but it seems a promising approach}.

More complex methods use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine a sequence of word embeddings  into a \textbf{fixed length vector},  which are described in more detail in section \ref{rnn}.
These kinds of models are good at  disambiguating the potentially many meanings a word might have.
Exactly what gets persisted in the final  vector representation of text depends on how the model is trained - two RNNs  trained on different tasks (such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition)  would need to store different information in its hidden state to successfully  perform their relevant tasks,  hence the encoding for the same sentence would be different for either model.
Still, an RNN  that is trained on one task could provide useful features for another.
Encoding text as fixed length vectors using RNNs has been interpreted as compressed sensing \cite{compressed_sensing_rnn}, with such vectors being ``provably at least as powerful on classification tasks, up to small error, as a linear classifier over BonG vectors''.

\subsection{Image Input}

Images can be represented as dense 3-dimensional tensor.
A 28x28 RGB image could be represented as a tensor with shape [28, 28, 3],  with the final dimension corresponding to the green, red, and blue intensity values at a given x/y coordinate.
These intensities  are usually in the range 0 ... 255, but are normalised before input to machine learning model.
Similarly to RNNs  encoding a sequence of words to a vector, 2D convolutional neural networks (2D CNNs)  can be used to extract dense feature vectors from raw images (image embedding),  further discussed in section \ref{image_models}.

\section{Models Considered}
\label{models_considered}

The following sections describes a selection of models that could be used for our classification task.
This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor is it a selection that is expected to have the highest predictive performance individually.
These models will later become part of an ensemble, where diversity matters much more than the performance of any individual model.
Engineering  considerations and time constraints also influence the selection of models: we did not want to spend time implementing models from scratch, or to use many frameworks for training models.
TensorFlow  is a widely used machine learning library with a good selection of open source models, and in particular a selection of pre-trained models for computer vision and NLP.
Therefore models that did not have an open source TensorFlow implementation were automatically excluded.

\subsection{Image Models}
\label{image_models}

Transfer learning has shown to be particularly useful in computer vision.
Successful computer vision models require a notoriously large training dataset, which would be hard to come by for every distinct computer vision task.
Instead, models are often initialised to the values of a model that has been trained on a large dataset such as Imagenet \cite{}, excluding only the last layer(s) of the model that has learned features that are specific to the original problem.
Representations learned at the lower layers are remarkably  universal and useful for other tasks.
Therefore pre-trained 2D CNNs can be used as feature extractors for various other tasks,  or the models could be fine-tuned to learn representations that are even more useful to the new task.
