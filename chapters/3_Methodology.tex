At the beginning of running all these experiments, the dataset was divided into development and test set (90/10\%).
The development set was used for


 we can evaluate the performance of the model on three types of datasets:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the test or validation set as labelled by the rule-based system (referred to as ``rule-based test/validation set''),
  \item the ground truth dataset gathered  before running most experiments,
  \item
\end{itemize}
