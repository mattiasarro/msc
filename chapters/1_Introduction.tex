machine learning (ML) has become successful enough  over the past few years to be a recurring topic in mainstream media and its use almost a requirement for startup funding\footnote{being driven by "crypyo" or blockchain is also acceptable}.
a lot of this newfound interest, hype, and hysteria is directed at  neural networks and deep learning. this focus is not unfounded - deep learning approaches continue to break benchmarks in  core machine learning research areas such as computer vision [cite], speech recognition [cite], and  some kinds of natural language processing  such as machine translation [cite].
reinforcement learning has also been revolutionised by deep learning, which is used in various robotics and control tasks, achieving superhuman performance in complex games and driving vehicles in real-world situations.
there are even limited results in  beating human at highly uncertain games with various actors such as Texas holdem poker [cite].

while bearing superficial resemblance to  natural brains, artificial neural networks are simply layers of non-linear transformations  capable of learning complex mappings from multidimensional inputs to (usually multidimensional or even structured) outputs.
the building blocks of neural networks are relatively simple and the algorithms for training them are universal; this makes neural networks suitable for a variety of domains and modalities, and opens up fascinating opportunities of multimodal and transfer learning.
being able to arbitrarily increase model complexity by increasing the width or depth allows the same neural network approximate more complex functions.
increased model complexity requires more labeled training data and increases train time - in fact deep models are somewhat unique in that they may continue to increase in performance when the dataset size increases whereas the benefits of more data taper off for many other kinds of models.
