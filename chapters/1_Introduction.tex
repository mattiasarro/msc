machine learning (ML) has become successful enough  over the past few years to be a recurring topic in mainstream media and its use almost a requirement for startup funding\footnote{being driven by "crypyo" or blockchain is also acceptable}.
a lot of this newfound interest, hype, and hysteria is directed at  neural networks and deep learning. this focus is not unfounded - deep learning approaches continue to break benchmarks in  core machine learning research areas such as computer vision [cite], speech recognition [cite], and  some kinds of natural language processing  such as machine translation [cite].
reinforcement learning has also been revolutionised by deep learning, which is used in various robotics and control tasks, achieving superhuman performance in complex games and driving vehicles in real-world situations.
there are even limited results in  beating human at highly uncertain games with various actors such as Texas holdem poker [cite].

while bearing superficial resemblance to  natural brains, neural networks are simply layers layers of non-linear transformations  capable of learning complex mappings from multidimensional inputs to (usually multidimensional) outputs.
the building blocks of neural networks are relatively simple and the algorithms  training these networks are universal and well studied, which makes deep learning  well suited for  a wide variety of problem domains.
at the same time, being able to stack more and more layers allows the same  kind of model  approximate more complex functions.
