\section{Visual Similarity}

Could also try image embeddings extracted from the last non-FC layer to extract lower-level fisual features

\section{Baseline Model}

it is questionable whether adding the same data to the deep and wide components is beneficial
  some justification is given by highway networks \& densenets; our version could be seen as a special case of a highway connection from the input to the output

\section{Independent Models}

Would be interesting to see results from character n-grams, gradient boosted trees, tfidf-weighted inputs
the same number of tokens was used for embeddings and 1-hot encoding; it could be beneficial to take nearly all tokens for embeddings that aappear more than once, as we're not adding input dimensions

weight decay not necessarily a hyperparameter
